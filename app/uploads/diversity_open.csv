American Rivers,"In my view, diversity means communities of color, LGBTQ, the poor, women, and all other historically marginalized groups are fully brought into and invested in efforts to conserve western lands and waters.  Equity means all such groups are treated fairly, with opportunities for all groups and individuals to contribute to and benefit from western land and waters.  Inclusion mean that all are made to feel welcome, and efforts must be made to accommodate differing creeds, colors, sexual orientations, genders, income levels, religious traditions, etc., and that all are afforded opportunities to participate, advance, and lead.","Aside from the intrinsic value of a diverse, equitable and inclusive approach to western conservation, its importance is two-fold.  First, it’s becoming increasingly clear that in order to remain relevant and effective in a world of dramatic demographic change, conservation groups in the west need to widen their appeal beyond their traditional white constituencies.  Second, conservation action will be much more effective if it fully engaged with, relevant to, and benefiting Native American, Latinx, African American and other communities of color or historically marginalized communities.  These are important constituencies that have a stake in western lands and waters, and have important contributions to make to their conservation.","American Rivers has established a standing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee tasked with developing and supporting implementation of organizational DEI goals and objectives. Two key focal areas for the committee and the work will be hiring and inclusive culture. We are at the beginning of the implementation phase of this work and thus far American Rivers has secured funding to promote all American Rivers’ job and internship postings on diversity-focused job websites in an effort to reach more diverse candidates. As part of the implementation of our DEI goals and objectives, American Rivers will be hiring an outside consultant to lead an all-staff DEI training that would enhance our day-to-day inclusive workplace culture and encourage hiring managers to address unconscious biases when recruiting.","Lack of dedicated funds is a big hurdle for our organization. It would be helpful to hire an outside consultant or consultants to help lead staff-wide trainings that would create awareness of and provide tools to address unconscious biases. In terms of recruiting specifically, it would also be helpful to purchase the software to setup an online application process that could better streamline our recruitment and allow for blind resume review. Recruitment software could also help American Rivers better track the diversity metrics of our applicants so we could determine if we are successfully reaching diverse audiences and candidates.","As organizations adopt commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) many, especially those primary funded through restricted funding, are limited in their ability to support more diverse programmatic work or explore new partnerships by the constraints of the conservation outcomes sought by the funding source.  General support for organizations to implement their DEI plans both internally and externally would support their commitment while providing a boost to the Foundation’s goals. This should include support for on the ground outreach efforts to seek a better understanding of the needs and values of diverse constituencies, some of which may not directly coincide with an immediate conservation opportunity but which would build trust and lead to greater collaboration in the future. The Foundation could support an information-sharing network for its grantees to collaborate on diversity projects and partnerships across the landscape, leveraging the partner’s experiences and connections.","The metrics that drive outcomes are often too narrowly focused (i.e. acres conserved, miles of rivers protected) to support an evolution within the conservation space that will broaden the constituencies served, expand potential partnerships and create more diverse program work. If diversity in our work creates resiliency, just as in ecosystems, then we need to allow some natural evolution to occur that will create a more diverse movement, build long-term political power by broadening public demand for conservation, while still achieving important and measurable outcomes on the ground. An emphasis on “non-traditional” partners such as conservative voices, veterans, and hunters and anglers has enabled us to achieve the conservation of some outstanding lands and waters in the West, but it has inadvertently narrowed the number and types of politically relevant constituencies for many decision-makers instead of broadening public demand for conservation. While these voices will always be important, we must also explore investments that make the case for why a broader slice of the public should care enough to support western conservation (e.g. protection of clean water flowing from public lands) particularly in politically moderate sectors. Lastly, support for projects and partnerships with historically under-represented communities that create learning and trust-building environment more loosely tied to conservation outcomes will help build relationships and identify areas of potential collaboration that we may not envision today."
Arabella Advisors,"[Please note that this answer will be consistent across NVF/Windward Fund/Arabella Advisors given the management of NVF and Windward by Arabella]  Diversity in a Western Conservation context means representing a wide range of voices on conservation issues: environmentalist, indigenous, hunter/angler, recreationalist/outdoorsperson, agriculturalist, urban planner—identities which all represent an interest in conservation from different angles (but are not exclusive, with multiple identities often being held by the same individual).  Equity means recognizing and adjusting to the different challenges, needs, and circumstances of diverse voices so that the voices are weighed to the same standard despite any historical and present-day advantages or disadvantages relative to one another. Equity requires intentionally pursuing outcomes to alter the systems that ensure people of color and low-income people bear the brunt of environmental degradation while also being excluded from leadership in the environmental movement.  Inclusion means lifting up the voices that have been/are ignored, maligned, or disenfranchised so that they hold the same weight in conversations about how to define and achieve conservation success as the voices that have historically been accepted and respected.","[Please note that this answer will be consistent across NVF/Windward Fund/Arabella Advisors given the management of NVF and Windward by Arabella]  The West encompasses a diversity of voices that represent an array of interests in how to live in harmony with others and with nature. Equity and inclusion are important because in many cases, those who are most affected by decisions about their communities are those who have the least say in those decisions. We must ensure that we recognize and lift up voices that have been historically (and are presently) disadvantaged so that approaches to solving conservation challenges take into account the full range of perspectives and needs of those they will affect.","We have forged partnerships with multiple community organizations to expand our networks. We have educated staff on implicit bias and removed ""cultural fit"" as a rationale for hiring. We've developed an internal affinity group called ""Inclusion Leaders at Arabella"" that advocate for changes within the organization that improve inclusion and equity at the firm. Read about our journey here: website","Encourage grantees to consider eliminating biased practices from hiring practices such as asking for salary history. Regularly engage with grantees about how they are integrating DEI values into their workplace culture e.g. ask in your application materials, ask in your reporting prompts, ask in face to face meetings.","Great that you are doing this survey: CONTINUE to gather this demographic and geographical information from grantees in regular reporting. The Foundation can explicitly say that it prioritizing programs that have diverse staff, that are run by people of color, are run by people who live in the communities that are affected by the issues they are trying to address. The Foundation can also be clear that it only funds organizations that are demonstrating efforts to make progress toward becoming more inclusive.","Anonymously survey or interviewee grantees about perceived power dynamics between Hewlett staff/consultants and grantee organizations. Have grantees not only provide input but also review your strategy before it is final. Be transparent about where the funder strategy and the grantees strategies are aligned and where they are not.  Examine how you inhabit power in meetings with grantees: are you giving grantee organizations the opportunity to take the lead and funding them for it?  Ensure that the burden of implementing a DEI lens does not fall only on grantee but also falls on Hewlett staff (e.g. Make reports (and metrics) streamlined and easy for grantees to fill out, consider check-in calls or site visits with grantees instead of formal reports, pay for data collection / evaluation efforts, and/or provide technical assistance to grantees with evaluation). Only ask for information that you’re actually going to use it.  Continue the internal work with an external facilitator to hold ongoing staff conversations about DEI—make it personal and make it ok to bring the personal into the work.  Be aware about how your due diligence process may be biased towards well-resourced organizations with greater capacity. Decide ahead of time to award a certain amount of funding to smaller organizations, and compare applications from smaller organizations against each other."
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers,"Diversity in western conservation means bringing together a range of stakeholders, interest areas, and demographic representation at all levels united for the single cause of advancing the long-term interests of conserving our wild public lands, waters and wildlife. Equity represents the idea of giving each of them a voice and equal consideration and ensuring that conservation doesn't come at the expense of other uses and interests. Inclusion means finding transparency across all activities and creating clear opportunities for engagement with open-ended invitations for participation and contribution.","One single group or individual interest area cannot adequately convey all aspects and perspectives of something as dynamic as western conservation. Additionally, we need a multitude of voices to carry complementary messages in order for advocacy efforts to yield consistent and winning long-term results. If we fail to motivate and inspire people from all backgrounds and walks of life, we fail the future of America and western conservation. Apathy is already a growing problem that exacerbates ongoing challenges with people becoming increasingly disconnected from the outdoors and the importance of our wild landscapes. It is our duty, as leaders and the current stewards of our natural resources, to inspire and motivate people to value conservation and understand its importance regardless of their geography or location and station in life.",BHA creates a welcoming environment that considers and integrates all qualified candidates regardless of their backgrounds and demogaphics. We advertise and recruit from all areas equally and select our candidates based on their skills and experiences. We don't ask people to provide demographic information in the application process.,I don't know that I have a great response for this. It is a common struggle and I am inclined to attribute more rigid barriers to the rationale for these challenges and I don't think Hewlett or anyone else can impact much change there.,Other constituencies may be better served by tailor-made outreach mechanisms but then we run the risk of it feeling and looking like a contrived diversity outreach program instead of a genuine effort to integrate and include various constituencies in a an equitable manner.,"We have to meet people where they are at, appeal to them in a way that is centered on their values instead of ours and demonstrate/communicate how they will benefit by engaging with us. We must inspire people to want to be a part of our conservation work instead of assuming they already want to be just because we say they should be. We must also continue to find ways to create engagement opportunities on their terms and meet them in their own communities and work to be apart of their lives as much as we want them integrated in ours. Finding thoughtful ways to be welcoming will be key to this as many of our organizations can appear to be overwhelming or even hostile and antagonistic towards certain constituencies."
Center for American Progress,"Our system of national parks, wildlife refuges and public lands means vastly different things to different people.  For some, public lands can bring a sense of solitude, healing or adventure; for others, public lands represent history, subsistence or economic opportunity. Diversity, equity and inclusion means ensuring that these various perspectives are surfaced, considered and valued during the inevitably complex discussions about land management.","Diversity, equity and inclusion values are key to efforts to conserve the West because they help ensure that the megaphone and deep pockets of the fossil fuel industry do not drown out key stakeholders, such as outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and anglers, and tribes.  It’s critical to encourage and elevate new voices to join the debate – ones that may have a vested interest in public lands but may not traditionally engage in conversations that will have direct or indirect impacts on their health, wealth and quality of life.  Ultimately, these efforts will help re-balance the scale such that more public and private lands are managed with future generations in mind – not just extractive uses.","As CAP grows, we continue to set more goals that further increase diversity. CAP’s executive leadership and Board are committed to building greater racial and gender diversity representation, and are actively pursuing candidates who will contribute their particular expertise and perspective to our mission and leadership.  While we have succeeded in recruiting policy experts and managers of color, sustaining and strengthening the diversity of our team remains a priority focus for the Board, Executive Committee and hiring managers. Key steps CAP has taken have included: publicizing job opportunities via networks, job boards and list serves that reach diverse communities; emphasizing hiring and retention of diverse staff within our management training; and launching a diversity committee initiative designed to support hiring and retention.","The Center for American Progress is placing additional emphasis on the value of the internship program to develop and offer a pipeline of diverse talent for the organization. Importantly, this includes a recent shift in policy to ensure that interns are paid a defensible living wage. As a result, the talent pool will not be limited to those who can afford to live in Washington, D.C. with a nominal income. One way the Foundation can support diversity is through encouraging grant proposals that build in reasonable budgets for intern programs.","Reaching new audiences and engaging new voices takes time, creativity and patience.  The Foundation can support organizations by first, clearly stating an expectation that diversity, equity and inclusion efforts will be valued; and second, providing the space and runway for trial and – just as importantly – error.  For example, the public lands program at CAP is in the midst of working on a joint report on conservation opportunities in the Farm Bill with the R Street Institute, a conservative-minded think tank.  While the co-authorship effort has taken twice as long and resulted in some watered-down recommendations, the end result will be a product that likely gets more traction on Capitol Hill because of the surprising partnership.","Too often, the conservation community follows a well-worn playbook of what voices and audiences to engage.  The simple act of being made aware of non-traditional and diverse organizations can help shake up the pattern.  Given the Foundation’s great convening authority – directly and through its grantees – there is an opportunity here to force the conservation community to pause, look up, and meet some new entities and constituencies that can offer refreshing perspectives.  This could be a simple as doing some behind the scenes matchmaking, drawing on the Foundation’s bird’s eye view, or a more involved series of meetings and conferences that bring together a diverse set of individuals and organizations."
Conservation Colorado Education Fund,"These values mean we must ensure all people have a voice, especially communities that have been historically left out of conversations and decision-making processes. These same communities are often the most impacted by environmental problems. The aim with applying principles of diversity, equity, and inclusivity to our work is to engage with, invest in, and listen to these communities, which are often separated out by race but also include geographic or socioeconomic factors.","Solutions that don’t take into account the impacts on frontline communities aren’t solutions. The future of the conservation movement relies on our ability to engage and elevate non-white, non-traditional voices. Not only are these values important because of the historical context of our work — the environmental movement was historically an affluent, white, male movement — but they are also important because including more people into our community is the only way to win.","In our hiring, we have worked to make sure our job postings are inclusive and are not written to artificially narrow the pool of potential candidates based on arbitrary requirements, such as requiring a degree or physical ability. We have also expanded our recruitment process for open positions by undertaking active recruitment strategies, reaching out to partners to spread the word about open positions, and posting on many different job boards reach different audiences. In the workplace, we underwent a formal diversity and inclusion training with all our staff, we require staff to incorporate these values into their annual plans and personal work plans, and we hold regular meetings of our diversity, equity, and inclusivity committee to ensure we are holding these values at the center of our work. In addition, we are working with our diversity, equity, and inclusivity consultant Angel Perez this year to formally review our human resources and hiring practices.","The Foundation can support internal projects for organizations focused on building these values into their organizational culture. This could include requiring organizations to include an equity component into all or some of their organizational effectiveness grants, or requesting that groups pursue organizational effectiveness projects that relate to diversity, equity, and inclusivity. The Foundation could also require in their grants that organizations include some component of equity work, and could specifically support groups that lack the resources to begin focus on this work.","As online engagement grows, organizations need to meet people where they are while also trying new methods and platforms for outreach. To assist in this effort, the Foundation could provide funding for organizations to explore engagement tools and platforms that have proven to work well with diverse audiences.  The Foundation could prioritize funding groups that do direct outreach to diverse constituencies, and making sure these groups have the ability to choose their own priorities and goals.   The Foundation could organize trainings for grantees to learn about how these values relate to Western Conservation issues and share best practices and lessons learned. This sort of summit would help grantees figure out how to think about these issues in a broader social justice context.","The Foundation can continue on this internal progress, but can especially prioritize distributing funding to organizations that are run by people of color, focus on reaching constituencies of color, or are fully dedicated to implementing these values. Directing funding to the organizations that are on the front lines of this work is an effective way to support these values. In addition, commitment to this work has to start from the top of an organization and cannot be seen as an appendix to the work. It must be fundamentally a part of the organization’s mission and everything it does. Rather than a destination, these values require an ongoing commitment."
Conservation Lands Foundation,"EID means all people have access to public lands. America’s public lands belong to all of us and must benefit all of us as they reveal our history, tell our stories, celebrate the diversity of our country and honor the myriad of ways we find connection and meaning in these unique places.",,"Our staff took part in an EID training in the last 18 months. We learned how to write job descriptions that appeal to a wide audience (removing masculine and jargon words as much as possible); we post our job openings on several divers job boards and look internally for candidates before posting to the public. As an organization we have an EID initiative in place and an EID committee that meets monthly to help guide our staff in making sure we are looking at our organization through and EID lense when completing workplans, looking for new partners, and granting money.",Resources for initial and continued EID trainings.

Earthjustice,"Achieving greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in everything we do is inextricably linked to Earthjustice’s mission to protect our planet and defend the rights of all people to a healthy environment. We believe a commitment to enhance and steadily increase diversity and inclusion at Earthjustice flows directly from our core values and is essential to achieve our mission. As our name Earthjustice indicates, we are driven by a passion for justice—for people and for the environment, by a belief that we can accomplish more in genuine partnership with others, and by a commitment to excellence and strategic action. Our commitment to working in partnerships compels us to build relationships where all partners are valued, heard, respected, and empowered, and our desire for savvy and strategic approaches benefits from a multitude of cultural and life experiences and communities. Our pursuit of diversity and inclusion recognizes that environmental burdens and benefits are not distributed equitably and we seek to address these historic and current disparities so that each of us can realize and enjoy a healthy, rich and inspiring world.","Despite our country’s pledge that all people are equal under the law, communities of color, indigenous communities, and low-income communities have historically and currently shoulder the burden of environmental impacts. Representing these disproportionately impacted communities and tribes is a critical priority of Earthjustice’s legal, advocacy, and communications efforts. These partnerships are essential to achieve our mission.","Earthjustice develops an annual comprehensive Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Plan to lay out our internal and external organizational goals for that year. Included in the plan are tangible objectives and metrics for accountability that will keep us committed to our vision. The goals reflect the work we believe is essential to do on DEI, both inside and outside the doors of Earthjustice. Inside, we will continue our work to recruit and retain multi-culturally sophisticated employees and to build a stronger culture of inclusion. Earthjustice continues to pursue diversity, equity, and inclusion both inside and outside our doors; our new DEI plan (see https://earthjustice.org/about/diversity-statement) will be published in February 2018 which we would be happy to share with the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation.","Funding to develop DEI programs, participate in DEI trainings, and have access to information – especially models for success. Some key takeaways, from our efforts to develop and maintain successful partnerships—so critical to DEI efforts—is to include the importance of deeply listening before acting; honoring the expertise that comes to the partnership from both sides understanding and acknowledging the historical context; and understanding and respecting cultural differences.","Funding to develop DEI programs, participate in DEI trainings, and have access to information – especially models for success. Some key takeaways, from our efforts to develop and maintain successful partnerships—so critical to DEI efforts—is to include 1) the importance of deeply listening before acting; 2) honoring the expertise that comes to the partnership from both sides (3) understanding and acknowledging the historical context; and 4) understanding and respecting cultural differences.","Lessons we’ve learned:  Our goals must reflect the work we believe is essential to do on DEI, both inside and outside the doors of Earthjustice and building authentic relationships is critical. Understanding progressive values provides the foundation on which to build DEI work, but it takes ongoing work and engagement, including building authentic relationships with others—both within the organization and with our clients and partners. This is particularly true for the environmental movement which remains largely homogenous and therefore requires active engagement with others in order to change. Diversity, equity and inclusion must be consistently embedded throughout and not an add-on. Training is important, providing information and tips and tools to raise awareness of things such as implicit bias, but training must be accompanied by time to practice and internalize the learning. It is important that everyone within the organization be engaged, especially senior leadership whose active engagement is critical to success."
EcoFlight,"Environmental issues affect every member of the public. Every community deserves clean air and water and can benefit from healthy ecosystems and public lands. In a time when we are faced with daunting issues like social justice, climate change and  health care, we need to reflect on the role of Western Conservation in each of these issues and each community.","Public lands conservation tends to be a top-tier issue for white people; over the past century black and Latino communities, minorities, gay and lesbian communities have sometimes been preoccupied with other more pressing issues and therefore may be less engaged in Western Conservation. Conservation needs a broader, more diverse and engaged base of political support in order to endure the constant attacks and bad legislation. Western Conservation needs champions from these diverse communities and would benefit from learning how public land and conservation issues are valued in different communities. Native Americans have traditionally been very involved in many of the issues in Western Conservation. Latino, Black and other minority groups are growing in number and their voice is needed at the table to have full inclusivity for all communities.","We hired another woman, to balance the staff at two men and two women.",,"Hewlett can suggest or encourage its diverse grantees to work together on specific projects through introductions, or through joint funding for multiple groups on a project.",

Grand Canyon Trust,"DEI means having organizational staff and board reflect the diversity of the country - and the region in particular - and creating a workplace culture in which everyone is free to be their whole selves. Organizations need to be mindful of the full and shifting breadth of diversity in the communities with which they engage, and ensuring opportunities for the perspectives of all to influence the priority work for their communities. Internal and external DEI efforts need to be coupled with meaningful action towards justice in order to not engage in tokenism among staff and in communities served.","The conversation around public lands conservation has been an exclusive one for far too long. This has led to fracturing and ineffectiveness, because important perspectives have been marginalized. For Western Conservation to remain a relevant public issue, we need to rethink who the ""public"" in public lands are, and what histories these folks bring to their relationship with public land. A privileged ""white"" discourse has set the tone for Western Conservation for a long time, and DEI values/initiatives represent a formal and intentional exploration about how to change the movement towards relevance in more peoples' lives.","The Trust has had a group of 5 staff working together on how to integrate DEI into hiring practices and workplace culture since November 2017, including the Executive Director, the Senior Director of Programs, the Head of the Youth Leadership Program, and two Americorp Vista team members. This group worked together to formulate the responses to this survey. We are considering contracting a DEI advisory firm to DEI  to conduct a training to sensitize all staff on DEI, and help organizational leaders to formulate a long term strategy for ensuring ongoing progress in this regard, for both internal and external DEI strategies.","Provide resources (financial and/or material) to help organizations: address how unconscious bias may be affecting hiring decisions and workplace culture.  craft more inclusive language for job openings and employ more diverse channels of communication to reach a broader audience and ensure that all qualified candidates feel empowered to apply. Additional resources to help organizations improve their approach to the actual hiring process (blind applications, open hiring meetings, etc.) create an internal support mechanism for employees to address issues and present ideas convene workshops with leaders of conservation organizations to explore different models of management, with an eye to encouraging more decentralized decision-making and the flattening of hierarchies. The purpose would be to foster diversity of leadership within an organization.
","Provide resources (financial and/or material) to help organizations shift their public communication strategies/methods to be more inclusive and relevant to a broader audience. In the same vein as inclusive hiring practices, Hewlett could also support orgs in working towards having their membership reflect the demographics of the region the org is working in. The Foundations should ask grantees to commit to a shared set of values, including in collaborative work they may undertake with other partners, and hold grantees accountable for holding up those values. Perhaps the Hewlett Foundation could provide instructive resources or examples of other organizations that have taken this on with success. Encourage grantees to incorporate questions on the organization’s delivery on DEI considerations in evaluation surveys conducted with constituencies served.
","Hewlett (and Western Conservation orgs in general) should approach DEI implementation with flexibility and humbleness. There are histories of oppression and exclusion that will be directly confronted if we're seeking to incorporate other groups into our work. We need to enter these conversations with humility, and be willing to implement suggestions received from these folks in a tangible and meaningful way. This will undoubtedly change what ""Western Conservation"" means and how we do our work. That's part of the point, and organizations need to be open to this change."
Greater Yellowstone Coalition,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion can mean different things in the context of Western Conservation. To some stakeholders in our work, these words have a negative connotation associated with a more left-leaning agenda and therefore can impede our ability to develop the collaborations we need to get our work done. To others, these are positive values that allow us to bring diverse voices to the table in search of conservation solutions.","Diversity, equity, and inclusion are increasingly more important values to consider in the context of Western Conservation, as the challenges we currently face affect us all. Growth, climate change, and other factors must be addressed, and we must include a variety of diverse voices in the conversation if we are going to successfully come up with solutions.","GYC strives to recruit and advertise for positions in a wide variety of publications and outlets. Due to the relatively small population in our geographic area, however, we do not get much diversity in the pool of interested applicants. The states we operate in are also not particularly ethnically or racially diverse, though we do strive to encourage and include diversity of thought, opinion, and experience. GYC’s leadership is committed to building and maintaining an organization that is diverse and inclusive. In our recently revised employee handbook, we identified one of our core values as “embracing diversity and inclusion” and we are striving to make that value show up in all aspects of the organization. GYC’s leadership team is reflective of the overall gender ratio of the board and staff, with two women and one man. Through our hiring processes and board governance, we are cognizant of the value diverse backgrounds, education, interests, ethnicity, and age bring to the organization. We also emphasize a policy of no tolerance regarding discrimination and have included the following statement in our new handbook: “GYC will not discriminate in regard to hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, fringe benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects of employment based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, disability, age, genetics, application or participation (past or present) in uniformed services, marital status, ancestry, sexual orientation/gender identity, or other characteristics.”","If the Foundation has resources available to share or train GYC on how better to integrate these values into our culture, we would be very interested in hearing about them. If there are best practices that we are not aware of, we would very much like to have access to that information.","We would be interested in hearing examples and learning from case studies that have successfully integrated these values into programming and partnerships, beyond what we already engage in at GYC.","We would encourage the Foundation to consider the fact that the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion have different connotations in the different geographic areas you serve. In rural communities, these values can mean very different things than in more urban areas. This has the potential to create challenges, but could also pose opportunities as you explore new ways to promote conservation values throughout the West."
Headwaters Economics,"Diversity is about ways people differ, including political differences and values, as well as race, ethnicity and country of origin; equity is about fair treatment; and inclusion is about creating an environment that encourages participation by all.","In our work we think first about the key decision-makers who can impact conservation. We identify key audiences and political actors up front and craft a strategy that asks whether we are communicating in the right way and with the right messengers. We acknowledge up front that the people we aim to influence are from a wide spectrum of political, racial, and ethnic backgrounds and that they sometimes hold values that may differ from ours. We recruit the right messengers -- ranchers, county commissioners, for example -- and we provide our research findings in a variety of formats depending on the audience.","Headwaters Economics strives to have the same diversity and in our approach to how we work. Staff of Headwaters Economics is relatively diverse compared to Montana where we are located (we are 80% White, 10% Asian and 20% identify as Latino, while Montana is 90% White, less than one percent is Asian, and three percent Latino). We are proud of our achievements in creating leadership positions for women, and for creating a workplace that acknowledges the importance of family through flexible work schedules (60% of staff are female). We have a culture that values and encourages differences of opinion, with lively and respectful debate, and we are skilled at listening and appreciating the perspectives of our varied constituents.","It is difficult to convince people from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds to apply for a job in a community where almost everyone is white and it would be useful to understand how to overcome this barrier.  The Foundation can also help organizations recruit staff with diverse values and political outlooks and different life experiences because conservation cannot continue to rely mostly on aging white baby boomers and the Patagonia crowd. The conservation movement and the Foundation has made significant advances, for example, is bringing hunters and anglers -- including those from conservative rural backgrounds -- into being outspoken and effective conservation advocates.  Can we do the same with conservative business owners and can we change the face of conservation so it looks more like rural communities?","It is important to be attentive to the values and perspectives of our varied constituents. Even though our staff is relatively diverse when compared to Montana and the West as a whole, what matters often is not race or ethnicity, but whether we are careful that we do not approach our work from solely from the perspective of the liberal and college educated. We constantly scan our work and ask ""did we phrase this in a way that would be offensive?"" or ""are we using terms that will set off alarms?"" The key is to spend a considerable amount of time out of the office, working with communities and elected officials, listening carefully, and learning how to be multi-lingual, using the right language for the right audience.  The Foundation can help by training conservation groups -- the liberal and college educated -- how to work better with rural communities.","Improving the diversity, equity and inclusion of non-profits is an important goal, but it is difficult to achieve if this is interpreted narrowly as skin color (I say this as someone who is White but self-identifies in large part as Latino because of my upbringing, and as an immigrant to the U.S.).  Diversity is not just about race and ethnicity. It is also about differences in opinion and life experiences.  To be effective in the West, especially in the rural West, it is imperative that we are able to listen deeply, empathize, and understand the needs of rural people, who are often White, with less formal education, who have a deep passion for their communities and the landscapes of the American West, but who feel left behind and ignored."
Hispanic Access Foundation,"In the context of Western Conservation, diversity, equity, and inclusion means that ALL stakeholders must have equitable opportunities and responsibilities in the work ahead.   White people have been the main champions of Western Conservation. Our national parks tell their stories the most. Yet, we know there is great diversity in America's historic, cultural, and spiritual connections to land and water resources. I compare it to the history text books in public schools. It's not a balanced narrative.   America's population has seen a dramatic change over time. Yet, the Western Conservation movement has made limited progress creating equitable space for different communities to enter into this work, authentically, meaningfully, and for the long term.  -All stakeholders must feel a sense of ownership for Western Conservation work to be relevant to them.   -For all people to understand issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion, we all need hands on experience and we can acquire this through long term collaboration and learning.","People from different backgrounds hold unique traditions, beliefs, and values including spiritual and cultural. DEI values are important because once understood and adopted, these values force us to think outside of our own interests and to incorporate the needs of others as we consider our behavior, attitudes, communications, planning, and decision making.  The integration of DEI values can be transformational for Western Conservation. It will lead to opening the door for a broader engagement, western conservation policies that reflect the best interests of diverse populations, and eventually change the internal makeup of conservation organizations to be more inclusive and diverse so that they reflect our nation.   As we all know, Western Conservation needs to be relevant to new generations and new communities in the future. Focusing on policy victories without making people a priority has worked in the past but it is not likely to work in the future.","Early in our organization’s founding, we hired the Culture Company to help us to establish the culture of our organizations. We brought together our team and a representative group of 50 people from our local teams and communities to help us through this process. It stuck. Our team is consistent and our key stakeholders know what to expect and how to work with us.   Members of our teams have received DEI training. For example, our youth programs directors conduct DEI webinar training's for our internship and fellowship participants; this developed out of a concern for fellows and interns as they enter job assignments in non-diverse environments (ie. a national park).   Members of our teams regularly speak at conferences and on panels on DEI and share our experiences both from the diverse community perspective and from our own programming.  Our national team is small but we have learned about the importance of internal and external practices of emotional intelligence.   The coalitions we work with include extremely diverse segments of Latino populations. For this work, we hire local community organizers that represent Afro-Latinos in the Northeast part of the U.S., Mexican-Americans in the Southwest, and Cuban and Central Americans in the Southeast. Gender, religion, identity, and age also play an important role in the people we serve.","-The Foundation could set the tone for others, for example, setting a goal of considering a very diverse set of candidates for a target amount of leadership positions and board seats with the idea of hiring the most qualified people.  -The Foundation could hire a new staff recruitment firm or consultant that has a track record for recruiting qualified, diverse candidates, and has incorporated DEI values in their business.   -The Foundation could invest in workforce development to create a pipeline for develops and integrates diverse talent into the conservation community. We believe this is a major gap that needs to be bridged.  -The idea is that if the Foundation experiences internal diversity, its grant making and partnerships should also reflect diversity in the future.",-The Foundation could provide funding to organizations to support paid internships and fellowships for qualified young professionals representing diverse backgrounds creating a pipeline of employees.  -The Foundation could strategically pair non-competing grantees and foster a trusted partnership based on mutually beneficial scope of work and promotes important DEI values learning experiences for both.    -The Foundation can best support other organizations by hosting an annual funders roundtable with organizations they do not yet fund that represent diverse constituencies to create a dialog and foster equitable access.  -The Foundation can consider elevating its funding commitments to its successful and most promising grantees who serve communities of color and ensures they to play a stronger leadership role in Western Conservation.,-The Foundation could develop a bi-annual 2 day event (round table). One day with grantee organizations and one day on non grantee organizations (primarily those who serve unique constituencies) to gather information and improve its DEI strategy organization-wide.
Idaho Conservation League,"While western conservation, in many respects, is about protecting values, for instance, water, land, and wildlife, virtually all strategies involve working effectively with people, be they constituent or stakeholder voices, policymakers, agencies, etc. When it comes to western conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion mean creating constituencies that reflect the true nature of a region. Many western values are based on federal public lands, and while a region may be overwhelmingly white, it’s often changing more than many realize, and federal public lands are owned by all Americans. If conservation is to endure conservation support needs to reflect the existing and changing face of the nation and its future. Also, in our region, there is lots of outreach to conservative, rural audiences.","While linked to the last question, this one leads me to leadership. NGO’s advancing conservation policies play in a bigger political pool than just conservation and they need to reflect values of what is just as well as what’s needed to just win. We are role models more than we realize. The best work in the West is work based on genuine relationships and DEI work, to be genuine, must be based on real empowerment and engagement. Using constituencies in a campaign, be they subsets of a demographic like veterans, or a broader category like Native Americans, must be built into enduring capacity building strategies for organizations and power building if they are to be genuine. Anything else cheapens or even harms the work over the long haul.","To be honest not a lot in an explicit way, for instance, in targeted recruitment. Idaho is a very white culture and we’re reflective of that. We are majority female (slightly) and multi-generationally staffed.","Good training is always a quality investment and in our case in particular, I’d be interested in a deeper understanding if we are in any way transmitting bias in our practices. I’m certain we’re not intending to, but our overwhelmingly white environment may have led to patterns we’re not sensitive to. Above I mentioned doing what is just rather than what just wins. We need to be at the top of our game here to do what is just and need to recognize we may not fully understand the factors in play.","Here we need to do what is just AND what wins. Idaho is white, and we do quality work with tribes, particularly the Nez Perce, but not a great deal more. Idaho has a growing Hispanic sector, and while generally this demographic is quite conservative, they are likely over-represented in impacts from toxics, particularly in agriculture. In our Boulder-White Clouds campaign we had some support to do Hispanic outreach and while it was very campaign specific, it could and should have been expanded on.","Please share successes. NGOs work in a bubble, particularly those of us in the interior West. In sharing successes and best practices, please seek examples from within the interior, conservative West. We have successes within the white conservative realm, but not a lot more."
Keystone Center,,,Made a diversity a priority for hiring and is a priority for the board nominating nominations committee. Have equity and inclusion as part of our employment policies.,Would love a funding source to recruit diverse students as fellows and introduce them to the field.,By continuing to prioritize funding towards those projects that include these values.,Offering strategies to grantees on how to incorporate these values into their work or projects would be hugely helpful - I think people are well intended in doing so but lacking skills or experience as to how exactly to incorporate these ideas into their work or thinking.
League of Conservation Voters Education Fund,"Ensuring participation in our democracy is a right and a possibility for communities of color, who are often the first and worst impacted by climate change and environmental degradation yet are among the strongest proponents of climate action and are the targets of voter suppression. Ensuring our efforts to protect and advocate for the environment are rooted in a deep understanding of racial and environmental justice. Ensuring that who we are, who we work with and how we engage reflects our nation as a whole and our organization's racial justice, equity  and exclusivity priorities and values.",,"Our hiring process is consistent and fair. We have high standards for ensuring a clear process is used consistently so that we are fair to every candidate. There are no side doors for bringing in people. We adhere to a hiring protocol. We recognize that one of the dynamics of inclusion is seeing that all people can succeed in our workplace. We know representation matters and that social justice isn't something we simply talk about, it's something we work toward. It's something we do. Our values must show up in who has opportunities and who is represented on the our teams, at every level. We consider our current team composition when we set strategic goals for recruiting candidates who bring the diversity we most need to the organization. Our work to create a staff team that reflects the country we serve is grounded in our values and our understanding that authentic representation and inclusion is necessary to achieve our mission. While these values have been present in our practices and culture, we have also engaged in a focused and intentional initiative over the last 18 months to increase the racial diversity of our staff. When we began these efforts, our staff was 21% people of color. By July of 2017, our staff increased to 33% people of color.","The Human Resources component to an organization's success in diversity, equity and inclusion is critical. Organizations need financial support and assistance to train their HR staff and organizational leadership on how to implement fair and equitable recruitment practices, and how to have the hard conversations about race, racism and privilege. Organizations can also benefit from financial support to not only diversify their staff but to also become welcoming and inclusive organizations to a rich mix of staff from different backgrounds and experiences.",Financial support to organizations whose programmatic work engages communities of color and support to organizations that translate their values into programmatic action.,"Provide long term, multi-year grants. Provide opportunities for grantees to convene and share experiences and stories of successes."
Montana Wilderness Association,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion should be as important in the context of Western Conservation as it is in the context of other social movements, institutions, or businesses. Diversity is the range of different people involved in the work, equity is the condition of equal influence over the work as well as equal access to the outcomes of the work, and inclusion is the practice of promoting equity among diverse people within the movement, institution, or business.","Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are important in the context of Western Conservation because they represent the who, what, and how of a just society. Broadly speaking, if community organizations, institutions and businesses do not actively include diverse people in an equitable system then these systems will produce unequal living standards. These facts apply to Western Conservation as much as any other social movement, institution, or business.    Importantly, the primary purpose of Western Conservation is to protect public lands, which are owned by all U.S citizens and enjoyed by citizens and non-citizens alike. The political strength of our movement and its ultimate effectiveness depends on whether this movement includes the diverse persons who own or use public lands and offers them equal influence over the work and access to its outcomes.","In early 2015, MWA staff redoubled our efforts to invite the influence of American Indians and American Indian tribes in our work. Our Badger-Two Medicine coalition, trail stewardship work, and Hold Our Ground coalition (National Monument Defense) are excellent examples of these efforts.    In fall 2016, MWA signed onto the “Open to All” initiative to support LGBTQ community members and employees. In spring 2017, we endorsed a state bill to add ""sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression"" to the Montana Human Rights Act, and we also opposed a bill that attempted to prevent transgender people from using locker rooms or bathrooms that align with their identity.    In December 2017, we began using the Avarna Group’s recommendations for hiring practices. This includes removing gender specific terms from job announcements and publishing salary ranges.","The Hewlett Foundation could support DEI integration to MWA hiring practices and workplace culture by providing additional funding for an external consultant (i.e., Avarna Group) to assist MWA’s leadership team and staff in the development of a DEI statement and assist with revision of MWA’s policy handbook to ensure policies support DEI principles and practices.","The Hewlett Foundation could support DEI integration to MWA programs and partnerships by providing additional funding to support the expansion of our public land stewardship work with American Indian tribes. Currently, we are in the fifth year of a burgeoning partnership with the Blackfeet Tribe, and we would like to expand this partnership in 2019 and 2020 to include the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Crow Nation.    MWA is also interested in building a conservation leaders pipeline for women in Montana. We’ve discussed this idea with the High Stakes Foundation, and they are willing to assist. We would welcome seed funding from the Hewlett Foundation to fully explore this idea.","We are grateful for the invitation to complete this survey and grateful for the encouragement to engage in the internal reflection and dialogue required to complete the survey.     Looking ahead, we encourage the Foundation to work with grantees to fund their DEI work and hold them accountable to best practices. You’re all probably way ahead of us on this point, but additional funding and accountability would be very welcome."
National Audubon Society,"Diversity is a beneficial side effect of a culture of inclusion, and diversity is a strategy towards equity in conservation. Data shows that non-white communities are more reliable conservation voters than white communities, and yet the legacy conservation movement in the west – even in diverse California – remains overwhelmingly white. This is not as true, however, of smaller conservation organizations with an articulated focus on environmental justice issues. For a legacy conservation organization such as Audubon, inclusion means integrating equity, diversity and inclusion across our functions and our network of chapters, centers and states, supporting our chapters to broaden their membership, engaging organizations that share a conservation goal, and building effective coalitions and partnerships.","In addition to issues of justice, the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion are important to Audubon pragmatically. California, Nevada, and New Mexico are so-called “Majority-Minority” states, with others soon to follow. If legacy conservation organizations are to continue their missions in the west, these values must guide all of our work. Without these values guiding our work, our constituency will continue to shrink and age out as will our power to accomplish conservation for birds, wildlife and people.","Audubon incorporates equity, diversity and inclusion into numerous aspects of our culture and hiring practices, augmented by close coordination on goals and metrics between the organization’s Vice President for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and Vice President for Human Resources.  We require all hiring managers to provide a diverse slate of applicants for all open exempt (professional) positions and to report slating and hiring results to the CEO and Executive Team; and for summer and entry level positions, we target a 50% hire rate.   Audubon’s biannual Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Summit at Hog Island in Maine assembles advocates from across our network and across the country for experiential group training, workshops and activities, after which they return to their locations to implement community based projects.  Our first employee survey sampled staff opinion on equity, diversity and inclusion and we just launched our first Employee Resource Group, in this instance, supporting women.  Audubon’s communication and content teams effectively incorporate a wide array of ages, races and ethnicities in printed and digital material.","Audubon would benefit from support in two ways, financially and intellectually. For example, when the foundation makes grants within a portfolio, sometimes there are opportunities for additional capacity building support to augment the programmatic grant—perhaps there could be similar opportunities specific to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts?  We would also benefit from a process of coordinated frank internal and external conversations implemented by Audubon about these topics that would enable us to identify issues and best practices, seek expert guidance and, if/when feasible, explore whether there are connections that the foundation can help us make—for instance, Audubon is in a growth phase and hiring a lot of new staff for various programs.  Are there connections to other organizations and networks that the Foundation can offer, which could serve as a new potential source pipeline for diverse job candidates?","The Foundation’s support for building conservation networks is essential. In Southern California, in particular, environmental justice and legacy conservation organizations largely are separated by race and/or ethnicity, culture, and language. In service of mutual benefit or to accomplish a shared goal, the Foundation can incentivize larger organizations to build the grassroots capacity of smaller organizations and provide services such as meeting space, communications support, and conservation planning expertise. Since much of the Foundation’s grant-making is accomplished through intermediaries, another idea to consider is deployment of legacy organizations such as Audubon as a pass-through funder to equip smaller environmental organizations for specific projects, which would help to foster collaboration and partnerships among various organizations. Coupling these with unrestricted grants to smaller conservation organizations could be transformative, supporting their growth toward effective conservation action. Finally, support for board-building for these organizations is needed, including financial, convening, and strategy supports.","Consistently, we are advised to focus on partnerships with grasstops, and on building authentic and reciprocal relationships with grassroots leaders.  We also hear about the importance of grassroots engagement in specific geographies. For the Foundation, translating that advice might mean connecting with other foundations as well as convening grantees, deep listening and learning more about their work, understanding their successes and obstacles, then formulating strategies based on meeting their needs. Another approach would involve leading with the specific conservation goal, and investing in relationship building, and building a coalition based on achieving that goal. Further, along with conservation in rural areas, remember to prioritize conservation in our cities and suburbs, and generous funding – more than the Foundation might first think is necessary, including unrestricted funding resources for urban projects.  Finally for nonprofits, remember that, ultimately, money talks; consider incentivizing new partnerships between organizations with significant dollars and creating a dedicated funding stream to support new grantees, especially smaller ones that tackle these issues."
National Wildlife Federation,,,"The National Wildlife Federation has five core values, one of which is “inclusivity” in fostering a climate that is open and welcoming to diverse people, ideas, and perspectives.  The National Wildlife Federation changed our mission statement in June 2016 to “Uniting all Americans to ensure wildlife thrive in a rapidly changing world”.  This was a leap forward in building the National Wildlife Federation's brand to new heights in terms of awareness, reputation, support and impact.  As a matter of standard operating procedure, vacant positions are filled when there is enough recruitment to locate and interview qualified diverse candidates.  A candidate pipeline has been created to assist in filling positions with candidates from our own emerging leaders and EcoLeaders programs as well as connections that we have established.",,"One of the most important things to do is to revisit and redefine ‘the conservation community’.  It can no longer be just the same set of organizations and demographics that it has traditionally been.  If we are going to make the protection of public lands and natural resources the ‘third rail’ that politicians won’t touch, we need to start connecting conservation to issues that matter more to people, build relationships with constituencies that we’ve previously ignored or tokenized, meet people where they are and invest in transformational rather than transactional work.  Hewlett can help by looking beyond the traditional boxes and investing in this transformational and relational work.  The traditional metrics of ‘acres protected’ should be revisited and compared to metrics that indicate the level of interest and engagement from broader constituencies that will become more important over time.  Success with broader constituencies, when combined with traditional public lands advocates such as sportsmen/women, could create a tapestry of public land advocates that is impenetrable.  Long-term public lands success will only be achievable if we invest in connecting with communities where they are, and doubling down on the connection of conservation to economy, health and community.  The West is being redefined due to demographics and urbanization, and the conservation community must change with it.",

Happy to discuss further.","Building movement infrastructure.  Identifying and funding mechanisms to create and sustain meaningful relationships and connections between leaders at the national and local level.  When I say local leaders, I mean diverse community leaders and not simply leaders of traditional local environmental groups. Good connections exist among national leaders and also among local leaders.  What is lacking is meaningful and sustained connections between these two different groups.   This is where I would invest.  Would welcome the chance to explore with you further.","Share what you have learned and where you have found the largest challenges.  This could be part of the substance of the type of convening proposed above in response to #20.  To be meaningful, I would suggest sharing with a small trusted group (12-15 people) over 1 ½ days, rather than simply sharing something in writing.  You would bring something to the table and so would the other participants.  With a focused agenda, each participant would learn something as well as contribute something.  I would include 3-4 local leaders, as well as carefully selected national NGO leaders."
Nature Conservancy,"We approach DEI from a paradigm that suggests differences are opportunities to reach desired results. Rather than seeing the wide range of differences in views about nature and people that characterize the West as a problem, we see this as an opportunity to develop more comprehensive solutions. In particular, we actively partner with Native Americans/First Nations consistent with our land and water based Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities strategy, our fisheries and forest strategies, and our fire strategy. We also have a long history of engaging with ranchers, hunters and fishers, farmers and landowners, youth, women, and all levels of government; more recently we have engaged in urban conservation efforts, particularly with economically challenged urban communities, many of whom are people of color. This broad range of constituencies enables us to listen and learn how best to tailor and apply our science driven solutions in the Western US context.","Critical stakeholders in the Western US include people holding a wide diversity of paradigms about the relationships between people and nature. TNC takes a pragmatic, non-partisan approach to engaging everyone, attempting to offer science-based practical approaches that need not be caught up in current political polarization. The ability to engage and convene together a wide range of stakeholders who might not be talking with one other otherwise is one of TNC’s core approaches to DEI globally, including in the West. The presence of significant Native American tribes and First Nations offer a critical opportunity to support the capacity of the historic stewards of large portions of the West to manage those resources sustainably, and the presence of large federal and state public lands offer the opportunity to knit private-public partnerships together to protect large landscapes and watersheds. These diversity dynamics are critical in the Western context.",,,,
New Venture Fund,"Diversity in a Western Conservation context means representing a wide range of voices on conservation issues: environmentalist, indigenous, hunter/angler, recreationalist/outdoorsperson, agriculturalist, urban planner, industry/business—identities which all represent an interest in conservation from different angles (but are not exclusive, with multiple identities often being held by the same individual).  Equity means recognizing and adjusting to the different challenges, needs, and circumstances of diverse voices so that the voices are weighed to the same standard despite any historical and present-day advantages or disadvantages relative to one another. Equity requires intentionally pursuing outcomes to alter the systems that currently cause people of color and low-income people to bear the brunt of environmental degradation while also being excluded from leadership in the environmental movement.  Inclusion means lifting up the voices that have been/are ignored, maligned, or disenfranchised so that they hold the same weight in conversations about how to define and achieve conservation success as the voices that have historically been accepted and respected.","The West encompasses a diversity of voices that represent an array of interests in how to live in harmony with others and with nature. Equity and inclusion are important because in many cases, those who are most affected by decisions about their communities are those who have the least say in those decisions. We must ensure that we recognize and lift up voices that have been historically (and are presently) disadvantaged so that approaches to solving conservation challenges take into account the full range of perspectives and needs of those they will affect.","A diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment are top organizational priorities for the New Venture Fund. Over the past few years, we have made additions to our board that have significantly increased its racial and gender diversity: of its seven members, two are women and two are people of color. This will remain a priority as we add board members as the organization grows.   NVF also employs over 387 staff, 70% of whom are women and 25% of whom identify as non-white. As a fiscal sponsor, we give our projects latitude in hiring staff: while we have an explicit and well- promulgated equal opportunity policy, the projects control the application of this policy in their hiring processes. At the same time, we are always looking for ways to communicate to our projects—many of whom live in and serve underrepresented and minority communities—the importance of diversity and inclusion at the staff level. NVF is managed by staff from Arabella Advisors, a philanthropic consulting firm that has invested heavily in diversity, equity, and inclusion (several of its efforts were recently chronicled in the Stanford Social Innovation Review). NVF draws on Arabella’s expertise in various ways.  Arabella recently led a session for all NVF staff on how to make a workplace more diverse, equitable, and inclusive through strong recruiting practices, and we have more trainings on these issues planned. As our organization grows and the social sector evolves, we will continue to work to ensure that our staff and board represent the diverse populations we serve.","a.	Start with measuring: asking grantees to report metrics. (Here we go!)  b.	Incentivize it: If the Foundation seeks to work with grantees that demonstrate a more diverse employee base, and attention to equity and inclusion in their programming, then the Foundation has the power to communicate that continued funding is tied to showing continued progress on demonstrating these values.   c.	Use the Foundation’s resources and network to bring people together: Support and/or build networks whereby your grantees can access a diverse hiring pool.  ",Express that this is valuable to the Foundation by putting money toward grantees who are doing this work. Show willingness to allocate more resources when grantees demonstrate commitment and need specifically for forwarding these values.,"a.	Ask your grantees, the experts, why things are the way they are. Seek to understand from their perspective why there is a deficit in the field of demonstrating these values.  b.	Ask what the impediments to demonstrating these values have been. Chart a course with their feedback on how to overcome those impediments.  "
Open Space Institute,"To OSI, putting diversity, equity and inclusion into practice means seeking out and listening to underrepresented voices in the communities in which we work. It is an effort to ensure OSI’s work is applicable to all segments of the population.","Our goal is to ensure that protected lands serve all people. Yet we recognize that the conservation field has fallen short in reaching diverse communities. We understand that recruiting a diverse workplace and engaging diverse stakeholders are the best path forward. Diverse workplaces—places that recognize, respect and welcome unique perspectives—are crucial to a successful organization. It is also the right thing to do, and with different voices, we can more effectively reach different constituencies.","In an effort to be much more proactive about DEI both within OSI and the conservation field, in 2016 we launched a program specifically designed to encourage the next generation of leaders to consider conservation career paths. OSI’s Conservation Diversity Fellowship, now in its third year, is a one-year employment opportunity which provides diverse candidates with a broad-based introduction to the conservation field, with rotations through every department. This success inspired us to deepen our efforts. Last year, we sought outside help in form of a DEI consultant that we contracted to conduct staff training, board training, an organization-wide assessment and a report with recommendations based on that assessment. From the report and recommendations, we will adopt DEI policies to address our specific needs.","Funding Green 2.0 and asking grantees to complete surveys like this are an encouraging invitation to examine hiring practices and workplace culture through the lens of DEI. The Green 2.0 reports provided vital educational resources to our staff at the beginning stages of our work. At the same time, at hegemonic organizations, it is impossible to undertake meaningful cultural shifts without outside help. Matching grants to support hiring DEI consultants for organizations willing to adopt DEI policies and practices would expedite progress.","As mentioned above, Hewlett is leading the way in various activities.  What OSI is lacking is data on usership in many of the areas in which we work, including who goes to parks and why.  If we are able to become better educated in this regard, our priorities and decision-making will be better informed to attract larger swaths of different populations.  OSI can be more intentional in its programmatic choices and its partnerships.  As a thought-leader, the Foundation can promote this agenda through education and fostering information-exchange. We would eagerly take advantage of opportunities to meet new people and form unconventional partnerships.",Your leadership serves as inspiration to us all. Continue to support addressing DEI in conservation and invest in and hire from diversity pipelines. Meeting new people and building meaningful relationships is incredibly effective.
Partners for conservation,"There is a broad spectrum of people and interests that have a stake and an interest in the conservation of natural resources in the west.  There is diversity in the traditional sense of sex, race, gender, religion and ethnicity, but also a broad diversity of perspectives and values placed on natural resource conservation in the west often times based on where people live and how they interact with natural resources.","Many times the focus of conservation efforts are on those that value natural resources from an altruistic, spiritual or recreational perspective, while placing less emphasis or ignoring individuals, organizations and communities that value functional ecological systems for the services they provide to the human community.  Leaving those folks out or casting them in an adversarial role limits the ability of conservation efforts to endure over time",,,,
Public Land Solutions,"Public Land in the West, will only be conserved and protected if it is valued by all types of people. Thus, diversity, equity, and inclusion in the context of Western Conservation means finding ways to share public lands with all peoples by pursuing, soliciting and incorporating the voices and opinions of all races, genders, ethnicities in our work to project and celebrate Western public lands.","Many communities in the West remain much less diversified than urban areas and minority voices often play a marginalized role in public land discussions. Diversity, equity, and inclusion values are important in the context of Western Conservation because diverse voices can bring a broader understanding of the underlying issues with regard to history, social dynamics, and current politics. Lasting remedies for conservation issues in the West will require the ideas and the support of all groups in the broader population, so not only do we need everyone’s ideas for solutions, we also need their support for implementation. Many communities in the West have marginalized minority voices, and while it’s the right thing to do to respect and honor diverse voices, it also greatly helps to understand the historical dynamics of issues such as environmental racism, and the best way to appropriately address such problems.","Public Land Solutions is a young organization that has only been around for five years and has three total employees. PLS was founded by two white individuals, one male the other female, and we have one female staff hired two years ago. Thus we have had little opportunity to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion into hiring practices or workplace culture. Nonetheless, moving forward we are committed to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion among existing staff/board, and with any future hiring decisions, we will actively seek qualified candidates of diverse heritage and backgrounds. This diversity will be increasingly important as we work more in areas with Native American and Hispanic populations.","This survey is a very good start as it encourages grantees to consider internal policies and what they can do differently to foster diversity, equity and inclusion into hiring practices. Also, the Foundation can strongly encourage grantee organizations – especially smaller ones like PLS that perhaps have not had much opportunity to consider diversity practices/policies – to develop a formal diversity policy and begin a conversation among staff and board about how organizations can become more aware of this issue and more effective in implementing such policies.","Land protection supported only by our white-dominant constituency of business owners will not be enough. The general support we receive from the Foundation has been critical to our ability to build a broad array of relationships with business owners and elected officials of diverse backgrounds in communities with diverse populations. Grants with specific schedules of deliverables can lead grantees to the low hanging fruit of the usual voices to achieve a goal, whereas more general support has allowed us to take the time to seek out and develop more diverse voices.  While perhaps there could be some specific incentive to recruit more diversity, at PLS our work with Hewlett has allowed us to move beyond the grant to grant, deliverable to deliverable cycle and giving us more time to recruit broader voices.","Consider asking grantees if their mission or project includes an opportunity to promote diversity either through staffing, partners, or constituencies. The questions would inspire thought and might lead grantees to pursue opportunities that might otherwise have been overlooked. In addition, consider elevating organizations (through grants and leadership positions on campaigns) that have a mission or project focus related to minority constituents."
Resources Legacy Fund,"Western environmental policies and funding have neither involved, nor taken into account, the full diversity of westerners. Communities of color bear the greatest burden of the adverse effects of inequitable decision making and have not proportionately enjoyed the benefits of environmental programs and approaches. RLF seeks to ensure that environmental priorities and outcomes better reflect the needs, values, and faces of the West, particularly in California, the nation’s most populous state. Incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusion into all our work, both internally and externally, will transform decision making and yield policies, programs, and projects more relevant to all westerners. This, in turn, will strengthen the overall conservation movement for generations to come.","RLF’s experience proves that the participation of broader and more inclusive constituencies strengthens and broadens environmental outcomes by better aligning priorities and resources with the needs of underserved communities, which in turn extends and deepens support for conservation of land, ocean, and water resources. Keen and steady focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion create better projects that improve more people’s lives and thus build grassroots support for natural resources conservation.",,,,
Sierra Club,"To us, embracing the values of diversity, equity and inclusion means designing and implementing our work in conjunction with racially, socioeconomically and geographically varied staff and partners, in a way that is responsive to the communities most impacted by the problems we are trying to solve, to ultimately make the world a more just, fair and healthy place. We must internalize and implement these values the context of Western Conservation both to help us foster a robust movement that can be successful in protecting wild places for generations to come, and to help us overcome the culture of exclusivity rooted in the history of the American lands protection movement. Finally, as greater percentages of people live in cities and are removed from any connection to nature, we must actively work to increase access and exposure to the great outdoors, so that we can inspire the next generation of environmentalists. People are much less likely to help us defend and protect our public lands if they have no connection to them, so fostering a welcoming culture in the outdoor movement and increasing equitable access both helps us make the world a more just place and achieve our end goal of protecting these cherished lands by inspiring people to help us do so.",,"Yes, the Sierra Club has been working for several decades to integrate these values into our hiring practices and workplace culture. In 2014 the Sierra Club Board of Directors adopted our first multi-year diversity, equity and inclusion plan. In 2016 Sierra Club doubled down on our commitment to equity, inclusion and justice by creating a department to manage our own internal self-transformation into an anti-oppressive organization. In that same year, Nellis Kennedy Howard was hired to serve as Sierra Club’s first-ever Director of the Department of Equity, Inclusion, and Justice. In 2017, all  850 staff and 150 volunteers will attend Growing for Change workshops.","Hewlett’s commitment to its grantees embracing these values is very helpful in allowing us the room to do this work. Of course, these investments take resources, and financial support specifically for this work would help us continue to expand it. Sponsoring paid internships or fellowships at our organization to engage in the advocacy work could also help provide entry-level opportunities that could increase the pool of diverse staff gaining experience in our field.","In addition to continued financial support, which allows us to do this important advocacy work in partnership with diverse allies and embracing these values, support from  the Hewlett Foundation to do this work “at the speed of trust,” as our Environmental Justice Program Director says, is hugely helpful.","The Sierra Club has embraced The Jemez Principles as guides for how we do this work, and are helpful, specific commitments we can all make as a means of living these values. We recommend these be integrated into your ongoing work as well. https://www.ejnet.org/ej/jemez.pdf"
Sonoran Institute,Greater diversity of engagement leads to more enduring conservation. Greater equity means more people benefit from our actions. Greater inclusion can reduce the extent of misunderstanding or opposition to our work.,Because the population we serve is diverse.,"As we have strived to become a more effective binational organization, we sought to hire people who are bilingual (English and Spanish) for programs and departments in both the U.S. and Mexico. We also are creating teams around issues and functions that cut across our offices in both countries.",Provide grants that allows NGOs to hire fellows from diverse communities. Provide general support grants to organizations that demonstrate greater commitments to diversity.,Provide grants that allow for re-grant to partner organizations that represent diverse constituencies as a way to solidify partnership and build capacity.,"Continue to get out into the field, visit with grantees and prospective grantees that demonstrate commitments to diversity."
Sustainable Northwest,"Considering diversity, equity, and inclusion in the context of Western Conservation means that an organization, group of individuals, or a single individual truly considers the impact—both direct and indirect, and short and long-term—that their behaviors have upon the people of the West who are touched in any way by conservation. Impacts may be felt by ecosystems, wildlife, economies, communities, social structures, cultures, aesthetics, and individuals in an indeterminable number of detectable and undetectable ways. Behaviors range from those at the organization level, such as strategic planning, project selection, hiring practice, organizational policies and office norms—and at the human level, like group and one-on-one verbal and non-verbal communication styles, tones, and words. Overall, it means being especially tuned into the world around you, deliberate, and thoughtful as you pursue conservation work.","The West is exceptionally diverse; but not always in the most obvious ways. Here in the Pacific Northwest, some take the overly-simplistic view that most people are Caucasian or that those west of the Cascade Mountains have the money and the desire to protect the environment, while those to the east are lower on the socioeconomic ladder and want to exploit natural resources. The so-called “urban-rural divide” is not only faulty thinking: communities in the West are obviously not that simple. In fact, the Pacific Northwest—both sides of the Cascades—have considerable diversity of ethnic background, culture, and opportunity (including the ability to adapt to change). These similarities mean that the principles and practices of diversity, equity, and inclusion likely transcend geography, but also must be tailored to the local socio-political and cultural dynamic if they’re to be effective. Conservation groups and our rural community partners face wicked, interconnected challenges that require collaboratively developed, durable solutions; and our success is dependent upon our ability to engage all those who are most affected by the impacts of unsustainable land management practices. This requires organizations to truly listen, learn, and include the views of the diverse people that live in the vast landscapes of the rural West. The majority of natural resources and the people capable of stewarding them for future generations reside in rural communities.","Programmatically, Sustainable Northwest prioritizes work and services in natural resource-dependent rural communities suffering from chronic unemployment, poverty, and transition in the wake of evolving political, economic, and ecological realities. We maintain a core focus on inclusion of diverse, underrepresented, and marginalized communities in key decision-making processes, and strive to ensure that solutions provide maximum benefit for long-term landscape and local community health. Operationally, SNW completed a strategic planning process in 2015 and engaged a graduate fellow of Asian-American descent, and the Board will advance a resolution to establish key diversity, equity and inclusion metrics within its organizational performance indicators along with financial health, community economic vitality, and ecological health. The organization also recently recruited two women and one Hispanic member to our Board. As part of its hiring policy, SNW seeks to broaden organizational diversity through hiring efforts, actively recruiting candidates of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, gender identity and sexual orientation, national origin, and economic background. Finding applicants that represent the cultural diversity of our primary constituencies served remains a challenge, but one we continue to consider how to address. In terms of workplace culture, we have historically maintained a very ‘horizontal’ and transparent workplace culture, where all levels of staff participate in organizational decisions and have access to organizational information.","Provide funding for development of diversity policies, offer matching funding to help cover some of the time for a staff member to lead diversity education and implementation, and ultimately, require future grant applicants to have a diversity plan in place as a requirement for grant award.","To be candid, making time to integrate new elements into already complex and under-funded efforts can be a real challenge. Partners are at hourly and mental capacity, agendas are full, and constituents are swimming in myriad difficult issues. Funding low impact education catered to rural and underserved communities—who as we have noted often don’t initially perceive equity issues in their places—is a good place to start, with a goal of slowly building DEI understanding and concepts into day-to-day activities and work plans. Once there have been capacity investments in conservation organizations, developing required equity trainings or an equity plan as a condition of funding for programming is another option.","Hewlett’s leadership on this issue is critical because diversity, equity, and inclusion in Western Conservation is one of the most challenging and under-recognized issues of our time. In implementing this work, it is important to recognize that there is no one size fits all solution for the range of communities in the American West; seek to both educate and learn from your grantors and their constituencies to decide how to best integrate place-informed strategies and requirements. Then, work to ensure that DEI efforts are complementary too, but do consume the work of your grantors. Clear guidance and reasonable expectations of progress can help assure that every successive project includes a greater consideration of these important issues."
Taxpayers for Common Sense,"The engagement of diverse constituencies, especially those adversely impacted by development on federal lands, starting from the identification of goals, planning, and strategies.","When diverse constituencies are engaged in policy change, the process takes longer, but the result is more durable. The conservation community has a long history of being criticized for being driven by elite coastal voices that fail to understand the nuances of western economies and communities. Regardless of the truth of that view, engaging a broader set of communities and providing earlier and equal voices at the table will help shift that perception - and reality.","In making recent hires, we have engaged a search consultant in order to attract a diverse pool.  We are expanding the board and prioritizing adding people of color and diverse backgrounds to the board.","The foundation can provide support to organizations to work with recruiters and search consultants, even for lower level positions, to ensure diverse candidate pools.  Often hires are not planned for (because of turnover) so there may not be budget to get recruitment help.  The foundation can also provide research on best practices and case studies that illustrate how to change workplace culture.",The foundation can convene meetings of diverse organizations and of leaders of organizations with diverse backgrounds and identities.,"Two things the Western Conservation program could do to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion would be to provide connections between leaders of different backgrounds in a setting where leaders can identify true areas of agreement and disagreement."
The Wilderness Society,"As an organization, we are committed to ensuring that our workforce represents the broad array of racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and political backgrounds throughout the North American West and all the places that we work. Our effectiveness as an organization is strengthened by a workforce that embodies diversity in all its forms — a rich mix of talent, work experiences, perspectives, backgrounds, and beliefs that we need to fully achieve our mission. Internally, we define inclusiveness as working as a team that listens to different points of view, recognizes the contributions of every employee and empowers each employee to bring their whole selves to work every day. Externally this means ensuring that public lands are inclusive and welcoming, so that our shared wildlands can help people and nature to thrive. We define equity as our commitment to realizing the promise of our public lands and ensuring that all can share in their universal benefits.",,"Since January 2017, all hiring managers seeking to fill open positions have been expected to follow standards outlined in a new Recruitment and Hiring Policy. Among other requirements, the policy specifically requires that a minimum number of people of color be included in the first-round interview stage. In addition, the organization has begun the important work of expanding our recruitment networks, as these are key to our success in attracting the best talent and building a team that truly reflects the communities we aim to serve. Recognizing our hiring managers and hiring committee members play key roles in ensuring our recruitment and hiring practices are fair and consistent, we have provided ongoing support and training in this area.  As part of our annual goal-setting process, all staff were asked to incorporate at least one inclusivity-focused goal into their individual workplans for FY17.  Finally, this past summer a Workplace Culture Working Group was launched with the task of better defining the behaviors that contribute to an inclusive culture.","Funding is critically important to success in these two areas—thank you for your support! As Hewlett evaluates organizations it is considering funding, it could ask for more detailed information, such as requesting strategic plans, to better evaluate each organization’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, their understanding of how these values impact their mission, and how they plan to integrate these values into their everyday work. The Foundation might consider requiring grantees to demonstrate a real commitment to this work as a condition of getting Hewlett’s support.","Organization strategic plans and goals should include a focus on the values of diversity, equity and inclusion, and in particular embedding equity into their programmatic work. Requiring these plans be in place before funding is provided may help evaluate how well an organization intends to embed equity across program work, partnerships and constituencies served.",
Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership,"Diversity, equality, and inclusion in Western conservation means to us that people with cultural, racial, economic, rural/urban, and other differences are not only a part of the conversation and debate about how our natural resources are used, but they also represent our membership and leadership as an organization, a community, and an interest group.","As America becomes increasingly diverse, it is critical to the future of our cause and our organizations that the participants in our outdoor activities represent the changing face of America. Otherwise, conservation and our community will become increasingly irrelevant both politically and socially. Becoming diverse as a hunting/fishing conservation organization requires intentional effort because most public lands available to our recreational pursuits are located in rural areas near predominately white communities, while areas with the most cultural diversity are generally urban and are located farther from our public lands.","We have strong diversity and inclusion policies in our employee handbook, which was last updated in December. We are actively seeking diverse board members and staff. We have added NGO and corporate voices that specifically represent Hispanic interests.","The workplace culture is not the issue; the issue is finding diversity in the applicant pool of people who want to work for conservation. To remedy this we have started reaching out to institutions (like the University of Houston) that are very diverse, and reaching out to partners like the Hispanic Access Foundation.","First, support efforts that specifically bring together diverse constituencies and/or support efforts in places (like NM) where engaging diverse constituencies is necessary for success. Second, make unrestricted grants to key grantees, thereby lessening the need for those organizations to recruit traditional (not diverse) board members who can support the organization financially.","A key challenge is that the elected leaders of many of the key (from a conservation standpoint) western states are not diverse (look at the makeup of the WY, UT, ID and MT legislatures, for example). Eventually, demographics will change those, but in the meantime advocates need to deal with the reality of what they are. This is a fundamental roadblock to conservation NGO diversity."
Trout unlimited,"TU considers diversity, equity and inclusion in the context of Western Conservation to mean that communities and individuals who have a stake in the West's lands and waters have an opportunity to meaningfully engage in decisions about their management and, with respect to resources in the public domain, an opportunity to responsibly use and enjoy those resources. It also means that diverse perspectives on proper use of land and water should be understood and respected, particularly those of communities and people whose livelihoods, culture, traditions and well-being are closely tied to specific lands and waters. Lastly, it means that the West's lands and waters should be shared equitably, and, when used, to the maximum extent practicable used in a way that preserves their value for other users, both today and in the future.","These values are important because they provide principled direction regarding how our lands and waters should be managed and used. They foster a sharing ethic and encourage taking the long-view instead of focusing on short-term economic gain when establishing policy and making management decisions, which makes policies and management approaches more likely to be broadly embraced and durable.","A major priority for TU is to diversify our membership, staff and leadership, and to create a more welcoming and inclusive community that extends from chapters to councils to national. The goal of TU's Diversity Initiative—a priority within TU's 2015-2020 Strategic Plan—is to create effective strategies and programs to recruit a more diverse membership profile in TU; encourage diversity within leadership at the chapter, state and national levels; and to ensure every chapter creates a welcoming environment for TU members of different genders, ethnicities, ages and cultures to achieve the TU conservation mission. TU is also committed to providing equal employment opportunity in all of our employment programs and decisions. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, recruitment and hiring, placement, promotion, termination, reductions in force, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation, and training.","While TU's leadership recognizes there is a lack of diversity at the organization, there isn't the knowledge, time and resources to address the issue in as an aggressive manner as desired. The Foundation could be helpful in sharing guidance and resources on best practices around issues of diversity. It would be helpful to learn what has worked for the Foundation and other industry peers through summits, roundtables, research publications or trainings, so we can learn and grow as a community. Funding to address issues of diversity would be beneficial and could increase the rate at which this important topic can be addressed at TU and other conservation organizations.","We currently integrate these values in our programs, partnerships and constituent services, primarily through the conservation outcomes we seek, which are designed to ensure that the West's lands and waters are conserved and accessible to diverse communities. Resource constraints are an impediment to adding diversity to our partner network and member base, though we are committed to identifying and seizing such opportunities. The Hewlett Foundation's assistance in connecting us with potential non-traditional partners who share our mission focus would be beneficial.","Successfully integrating these three values in the Western Conservation strategy requires understanding the West's cultural, demographic and economic diversity in a geo-spatial context.  As the past year has clearly demonstrated, there is often a large divide separating rural and urban communities in the West due to cultural, economic and value differences. Based on our experience we firmly believe that narrowing and bridging this divide through dialogue and finding common interests between geographically and culturally separated communities is of paramount importance to the maintaining and restoring the West's ecological integrity. We offer that the Hewlett Foundation would be well served to focus resources on strategies and tactics that achieve this goal and by increasing the capacity of grantees to more effectively build bridges between the West's rural and urban communities."
Western Conservation Foundation,"Healthy air, land and water are basic human rights. Unless development and industry are carefully managed, underprivileged (often minority) constituencies will be most impacted by the degradation of our environment. Social justice and conservation advocates should work together to defend against inequitable conservation policies, and to enact policies that protect our environment and our people. Beyond this, we should evolve beyond the stereotype of the white urban professional “environmentalist” to show the true diversity among Americans who use and love our public lands.","At the core of Western Conservation Foundation’s mission is the belief that when more constituencies are included in the public dialogue about conservation values, more lasting positive change will occur. WCF believes that, through inclusion of diverse constituencies, the west will reap the benefits of both stronger policies protecting our air, land and water, and of a broader base of environmental stewards, committed to ensuring the outdoor spaces they retreat to for fun and solace are protected. Beyond this, regressive environmental policies often have an outsized impact on low-income, often minority communities. It is the job of all conservation advocates to expose and fight this social inequity.","WCF does not have formal practices for integrating diversity, equity and inclusion into our hiring practices. We recently held a day-long training with the Management Center that included a discussion of best practices around integrating diversity, equity and inclusion into our workplace culture. Staff now have Management Center materials to help them determine how best to incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion into their program work. Beyond this, a core strategy of WCF is engaging nontraditional conservation voices, through which we encourage more diverse voices to engage and be heard on conservation issues.","Providing training in cultural competency to grantees and possibly even providing funding for re-granting organizations like WCF to offer similar trainings to our grantees would help WCF and our grantees to better integrate these values into our workplace culture. Further, this training could strengthen the pipeline of diverse job candidates for funding organizations like WCF.","Encouraging more diverse individuals and organizations to become engaged in conservation issues would further integrate these values throughout the conservation community. This could be done through a leadership recruitment/training program focused on diverse constituencies or through integration of social justice or minority focused organizations into conservation coalitions. Also, the more our elected officials hear from organizations and constituents from diverse backgrounds about the need for conservation leadership, the more they will associate these important stakeholders with the need for conservation protections; thus further integrating these values into our communities and organizations.","We hope that the Foundation will consider helping to forge uncommon partnerships amongst its grantees representing different constituencies. Often organizations representing different constituencies share similar advocacy goals but they do not work collaboratively to reach those goals. While any new partnership can present short-term challenges, they offer valuable lessons to each organization and (when strategically formed) create a formidable force for change."
Western Landowners Alliance,"In the context of Western Conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion means more than ensuring different types of people have a nominal seat at the table. It means recognizing and creating opportunities and contexts which invite, inspire and empower full participation, ownership and leadership. It also means recognizing the legitimacy and value of different stakeholders and perspectives.","Successful and enduring conservation on an increasingly crowded planet can only succeed through cooperation, which in turn requires positive working relationships built on trust.This means we have to be able to know and understand one another across differences, which requires respect, equity and inclusivity. In addition, societal wellbeing and ecological health go hand-in-hand. Both people and land bear the consequences of social and economic inequity and strife. Finally, as diversity enriches an ecosystem, so diverse human perspectives and values enrich our collective knowledge and interaction with the world around us.","While WLA does not recruit staff based on specific diversity targets, we welcome diversity and maintain an environment of equity and inclusion. While our staff is relatively small and does at the moment lack the degree of racial diversity we would like to see, we have had greater racial diversity at times and are currently highly diverse in terms of gender, age, religion, ethnicity and sexual orientation. The values and expectations around diversity, equity and inclusion are openly discussed and promoted at every level of the organization.","Perhaps the foundation could help by identifying channels through which organizations can attract diverse and qualified job applicants. We often feel our applicant pool is too limited. We post our job openings on the usual environmental sites, High Country News and to our networks, for example. We used to advertise on Monster and Indeed but have been unable to find qualified candidates in the past from either of those sites.","We need to be able to build relationships and collaborate with different groups, but that takes time and investment. So much of conservation has focused on ""acres conserved"" or ""stream miles restored"" with far less emphasis on building positive relationships. Providing funding to engage with diverse stakeholders could be helpful. Asking grantees to consider and report on these values in the course of their work is also a useful way to make sure they remain a focus and priority.","Support place-based collaborative conservation. Consider the ways in which conservation actions may impact livelihoods, rural economies and cultures. Support communications and educational outreach designed to engage diverse people. Provide support for women's development and leadership at the intersection of agriculture and conservation."
Western Resource Advocates,"In addition to the overall need to apply DEI to our organization’s hiring and employment practices, our understanding of DEI in relation to Western Conservation includes:  1) The need to diversify the set of partners we collaborate with in order to leverage their unique perspective and influence, and 2) The need to build leaders within the community with a broader range of skill sets and racial and ethnic backgrounds.","If we hope to secure lasting solutions to conservation challenges, then we must do a more effective job of building support by incorporating more diverse perspectives, values, and concerns into our agenda. Western communities are increasingly diverse. For our team to develop truly viable, comprehensive goals and strategies, it must be comprised of individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives.","WRA’s Senior Leadership Team recently developed our first DEI goals and strategies for the organization. We committed to ensure that 50% of our new hires in 2018 are people of color and that we create leadership opportunities for women and diverse employees. We plan to develop and publish our commitment to diversity on our website, more actively recruit diverse candidates, ensure that job postings use language that is gender balanced, create mentoring opportunities for junior staff and identify partnerships with multicultural organizations to create a fellowship or internship program.","As an important part of our short- and long-term priority goals, WRA leadership is committed to becoming a more diverse organization; however, we would benefit enormously from increased access to best practices, expertise, and networking opportunities.","As part of the proposal process, and when appropriate, encouraging or requiring organizations to identify the communities that their proposed work will serve, and how they considered DEI in their proposal, could increase awareness and efforts to further integrate these values. In addition, support for organizations to provide entry-level training opportunities and fellowships that develop diverse individuals’ skills and competencies, could provide opportunities for those individuals to advance into other roles within the organization.",Facilitate partnerships between diverse entities and existing grantees in addition to supporting separate campaigns that promote diverse voices. There are a lot of white faces at our coalition meetings. The Foundation is uniquely positioned to get the right people in a room together to work toward shared goals.
Western Rivers Conservancy,"When Western Rivers Conservancy (WRC) acquires land along a river, it becomes a publicly accessible, community treasure. Not for some, but for all. WRC knows that healthy rivers provide wide-ranging benefits for people of all backgrounds, ensuring clean water, offering outdoor experiences that connect people with nature, and providing natural flood-plain services that keeps communities safe during times of high water. We partner with indigenous and rural communities, farmers, ranchers and other stakeholders that are not typically at the table for environmental causes. WRC believes it is important to partner with many diverse groups to make our projects richer, stronger and more successful in the long-term.","WRC recognize that our mission is best served by a board and staff from diverse backgrounds and cultures, and we are committed to creating an organization that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve. We are also committed to maintaining a culture that is not only free from discrimination, but actively inclusive of the rich and varied perspectives that diversity brings. WRC strives to be a place of fairness and openness regardless of differences in culture, background or point of view. At the core of these commitments is our fundamental belief in the dignity and value of each individual, and the knowledge that we are at our best when working together to save the great rivers of the West.","On both the Board and staff level, we’ve spoken frequently about our desire to increase diversity at WRC. In October 2017, our Board approved a resolution affirming WRC’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. In the next year, we will plan to hire a DEI consultant to conduct an organizational DEI assessment and develop plans to enhance our organizational DEI capacity.","The Hewlett Foundation can continue to share best practices that you have identified while advancing your own organization DEI capacity. For example, it was helpful to receive the Sample Demographic Data Survey Form included in your survey materials.",Hewlett can share more anecdotes/examples about how different organizations have incorporated DEI values and integrated them with their mission and strategic goals.,"In these times, the Hewlett Foundation could help conservation organizations, all at various stages in their DEI work, learn how to move their DEI values and goals forward, while simultaneously advancing their mission work."
Wild Salmon Center,"Historically, the conservation movement has excluded poor communities and communities of color. These same communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change, salmon declines, deforestation, and pollution. A conservation movement that truly embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion is one that addresses the historical impact of our exclusion and incorporates environmental justice into every aspect of its work. It’s about protecting water, air quality, and fish and wildlife habitat as well as ensuring equitable access to these shared natural resources.","Addressing the FULL ecological, cultural, economic, and health impacts of environmental destruction requires us to commit to diversity, equity, and inclusion values. We cannot be successful in this work if we ignore the impacts on our society’s most marginalized communities. These values are also important for building a constituency for the future. As a country we are diversifying. If conservation organizations want to secure lasting conservation wins we need to build a broader base of donors and activists to support us and the work long-term.","WSC created a DEI committee in the fall of 2016 to lead the organization’s efforts to become more fully inclusive. In 2017 the committee conducted a self-audit using the Tool for Organizational Self-Assessment Related to Racial Equity created by the Coalition of Communities of Color. The audit was extremely helpful for identifying several growth opportunities for the organization including workforce composition and quality, community collaboration, board diversification, racial equity policies and implementation practices, data collection, and others. Last month we were awarded a grant from the Meyer Memorial Trust to hire an outside consultant to lead the organization on a series of DEI trainings in 2018. Our DEI committee has already started working with the consultant and has a day-long Discovery retreat scheduled for February 15th.","Providing learning opportunities through workshops, webinars, and mentorship programs; giving grants to hire consultants or attend DEI trainings; and/or creating/maintaining a “library” of DEI resources for organizations to access. Funding to recruit/hire interns specifically from marginalized communities would benefit organizations as well as provide training opportunities for individuals.","In addition to the suggestions in #20, collaborative planning grants would be helpful to encourage different groups to work together and to make collaboration possible. Sometimes hiring an outside consultant to guide the groups is key to success, but often cost prohibitive. Simply continuing to push the issue in the western conservation community is huge! The more foundations prioritize (and fund) this work, the more nonprofits will work towards integrating DEI values in all aspects of our work.","Hire people of color, women of color in particular, indigenous people, and LGBTQ+ folks and promote them throughout your foundation. The more people of color, indigenous people, and LGBTQ+ people you have working in high-level positions/shaping your programmatic priorities, the better. Follow the lead of the most marginalized."
Windward Fund (Water Funders Initiative),,,"Providing a vehicle for inclusive and equitable grantmaking that can elevate the voices of those most impacted by environmental degradation is one of Windward Fund’s three strategic goals approved by our board, in order to help Windward build a stronger environmental movement. The Windward Board and staff are still fleshing out our strategic plan on how to most effectively implement this goal, but steps that we are building out implementation plans for include: increasing access to training and capacity-building resources for projects (including webinars on topics such as incorporating DEI into hiring practices) and facilitating information exchange across projects (network-building). Windward’s Board is considering how we can best engage with sector-wide initiatives to promote DEI in environmental grantmaking (such as Green 2.0 and InDEEP) and identify practices and trainings that Windward can recommend to its projects.   Windward is managed by staff from Arabella Advisors, a philanthropic consulting firm that has invested heavily in diversity, equity, and inclusion, and Windward draws on Arabella’s expertise in various ways. As our organization grows and the social sector evolves, we will continue to work to ensure that our staff and board represent the diverse populations we serve.",,,
